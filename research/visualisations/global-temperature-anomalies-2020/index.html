        <noscript>With JavaScript enabled, this section of the article shows an animated chart illustrating the rise of global average temperatures in the most recent decades. While there is some statistical uncertainty in annual estimates of global average temperatures, it does not affect the conclusion that they are increasing over time. A warming trend is evident even as the individual annual measurements move within the estimated range of uncertainty. In 2020, global average temperatures were almost one degree Celsius higher than in the period 1961 to 1990.</noscript>
