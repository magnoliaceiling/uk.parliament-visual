                <p>On this map, each constituency is represented by a single square. Constituencies are grouped into traditional county areas and other labelled sub-national groups. These areas don't have any electoral significance, but may help identify results in different parts of the UK. This map has been produced by the <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk">House of Commons Library</a>.
